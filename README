Source for hemingwire-alpha.com :

A Ruby on Rails web app. (Unfinished; as of 3/19, not expecting to finish)

Project Details:
   hemingwire is a website for book readers who wish to read and write opinions related to specific novels. The site has a narrow scope; we see this as a strength. Many social media sites pretend to be one-stop-shops for all social needs. Not us. Come to hemingwire for opinions on books, period. 

To fellow developers:
   Originally, this app was a sandbox I used to teach myself Ruby on Rails, so don't be surprised to find heinous flaws.
